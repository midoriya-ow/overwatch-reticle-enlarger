# Overwatch Reticle Enlarger
_**NOTE: Blizzard technically doesn't really like third-party applications in Overwatch. I don't know the in-game legality when it comes to accessiblity scripts, but I take no responsiblity for account actions or bannings!**_

_**See [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/unauthorized-third-party-software/213220) for the official Blizzard statement on such applications.**_

This Python script will hopefully enlarge and enhance the reticle in-game on Overwatch for those who have a hard time focusing on one area in-game.

##Requirements

Python 3.x will do. Tested with Python 3.7.2 on Windows, so I know that much.

Once the script advances, I will post dependencies needed.
